## About me

- Postdoctoral Researcher, Aalto University 2019 - 2020 
- Doctor of Science (Technology), Aalto University 2019

My doctoral dissertation entitled "[Metric compactification of Banach spaces](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/41224)" 
was supervised by [Anders Karlsson](http://www.unige.ch/math/folks/karlsson/) at University of Geneva, 
and [Kalle Kytölä](https://math.aalto.fi/~kkytola/) and [Olavi Nevanlinna](https://math.aalto.fi/en/people/olavi.nevanlinna) 
at Aalto University.

My research work focuses on the interplay between Metric Geometry, Functional Analysis, and Probability.
